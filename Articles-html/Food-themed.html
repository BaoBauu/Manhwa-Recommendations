      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p id="Eat-and-Go">Our protagonist, Kang Cheol-ho, once the strongest warrior summoned to another world, returns to Earth after decades of battle, only to find it plagued by monster raids. Tired of war, he abandons his sword and pursues a new dream: opening a humble restaurant where weary hunters and strangers can find solace through a warm meal and listening ear. A heartfelt story of food, healing, and second chances.
      </p>
      <h4>Review</h4>
      <p class="review">With only six chapters so far, Go and Eat presents an intriguing fusion of monster battles and heartfelt culinary storytelling. At its core is Kang Chul-ho, a refreshing take on the overpowered hero and hidden OP protagonist trope. Instead of chasing more fights, he seeks peace and fulfillment through food. However, unlike many characters in similar stories, he does not hide his past identity or hesitate to use his powers when necessary. This departure from the usual trope may be a welcome change for some readers, while others might find it frustrating depending on their expectations.

The contrast between his warrior past and his present life as a humble restaurateur adds depth to his character, making his journey more compelling. The art style, though simple, is clean and expressive effectively capturing both intense action scenes and the cozy atmosphere of the restaurant.

Given the story’s early stage, this review remains incomplete, as its full potential is yet to be realized. For now, Go and Eat stands as a promising read, offering a unique blend of action, healing, and second chances.
